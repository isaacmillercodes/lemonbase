## Lemonbase

The goal of this project was to create a React app that allows a user to input a Bitcoin address and see payments sent to that address.

You can find the deployed site [here](https://lemonbase.herokuapp.com/)

Current Features:

* Users can see transaction data in real time via Web Sockets
* Users can input multiple addresses and see all their transactions on one page

Future Plans:

* Create a Node/Express/GraphQL/PostgreSQL back end to allow users to log in and save previous addresses and transactions.
* App-wide styling overhaul implementing Sass for mix-ins and variables.
